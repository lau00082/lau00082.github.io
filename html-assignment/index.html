      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Hey amazing souls!! I'm Ivan from Hong Kong! I am that type of person who will make you laugh all the time. I believe life is better with more smiles. If you're feeling a bit low or just need a pick-me-up, guess what? You're in the right place! Come chat with me, and I'll be your personal sunshine on a cloudy day.</p>

      <h1>Things I like</h1>

      <p>I consider myself a creative enthusiast. Whether it's drawing, fashion, video creation, or graphic design, expressing my creativity is where I find joy. I also enjoy embracing challenges, whether it's learning a new skill, a language, or picking up a fresh hobby. I don't like staying in my comfort zone because I find excitement in the thrill of the unknown. If it's adventurous and pushes boundaries, you can count me in!</p>
